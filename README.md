# Avi Coin

Avi Coin is a personal project aimed at improving my skills in:

- **Rust**: Enhancing my proficiency in Rust programming.
- **Bitcoin Knowledge**: Understanding how Bitcoin works by implementing a similar coin from scratch.

## Goals

The primary objective of this project is to build a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency **without referencing any Bitcoin code**, using only Rust. I'll rely on online resources, particularly [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/), to guide the development.

While this implementation won't match Bitcoin in terms of **security or features**, it will serve as a simplified version covering fundamental concepts.

## Disclaimer

This project is purely for **learning purposes**. It is **not** intended for real-world use.
